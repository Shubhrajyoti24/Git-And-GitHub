About me

Hello!
I am Shubhrajyoti, currently pursuing my first year of Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla. 
I am from Balasore, Odisha. I have completed my schooling from Kendriya Vidyalaya Balasore. 
In my spare time, I would love to learn a new skill, may be learning a new programming language or a new painting technique.
I have always been a very creative person and find it relaxing to indulge in craft activities.
Proficient in C, C++, SQL and basics of HTML and Python, I am passionate about learning more and implementing for requirements into technical solutions.
Other than this I am good at organizing and presentation skills, leadership skills and of course I like to work within deadlines.
